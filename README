=== Conky Colour Change ===

A Lua script and accompanying Conky config which allow users to define colours
and colour transitions for their Conky indicators

*** Intallation Instructions ***

Transfer conky.conf and colour-change.lua to the .conky directory of your home
directory. If this doesn't exist create it with:
mkdir -p ~/.conky
Use the script by invoking conky using the following from the terminal:
conky -c ~/.conky/conky.conf

If you wish to change the location of the conf file or the lua script, or rename
either, you will need to alter the conf file to point to the new location of the
script and alter the command line invocation of conky to reflect the new
location of the conf file
